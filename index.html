		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>
		I am a 22 years old aspiring programmer from germany. I have a bit of experience in C#/.NET, mainly WPF and Xamarin.Forms. I've also done some experimenting with (ASP) .NET-Core. I am currently in training to become a fully fledged (certified) programmer.

		<h1>What am I currently working on?</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jeanluc162/Omegle-.NET">Omegle-.NET</a>, an <a href="http://omegle.com">Omegle</a> wrapper library. Normal chatting is basically complete, but I'd like to implement video functionality at some point in time.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jeanluc162/ZipCrackNetCore">ZipCrackNetCore</a>, a simple commandline utility for bruteforcing ZIP-passwords. It already works, but I'd like to expand it's capabilities to use multiple threads.</li>
			<li>00Chat, a decentralized (meaning split across multiple (user run) servers) chatsystem based on ASP .NET-Core. It will be released under the MIT-License once I am not ashamed of it anymore.</li>

		<h1>Why is this Website so ugly?</h1>
		<p>
		I like the aesthetics of the late-90s web, minus the <s>blinking</s>/scrolling text. Also, I don't want anyone to ask me to design a website for them.

	<div id="contact">
		<h1>How can I contact you? And why would I want to do that?</h1>
		<p>
		My email adress can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jeanluc162">my github page</a>. Why would you need it? I am always interested in contributing somewhere, so if you want a helping hand I might be a viable option!
